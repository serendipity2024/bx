# BuilderX Designer

To start

```
yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To run the example:

```
cd example
yarn
yarn start
```

To build

```
yarn build
```

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.
